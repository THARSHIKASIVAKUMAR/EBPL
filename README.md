# Q-ControlX â€“ Autonomous Quality Control MVP

A 2-day solo-build prototype to demonstrate proactive defect detection using AI, simulated IIoT data, and a basic digital twin feedback loop.

## Features
- Synthetic sensor data stream (temperature, vibration, etc.)
- AI-based defect prediction (Random Forest)
- Simulated machine state (digital twin logic)
- Real-time feedback loop (e.g., reduce speed on high risk)
- Streamlit dashboard for live monitoring
